# imagescorer

This is a REST service to identify objects in images.

Build this image with `docker build -t imagescorer .` and run it with `docker run -p 8080:8080 imagescorer`.

If you have [HTTPie](http://httpie.org) installed, you can use the included `payload.py` script to test, e.g.,

`./payload.py some_file.jpg | http -j localhost:8080/v2/yolo`

The first score will be slower than subsequent ones.

Currently there's not really any error checking.  In particular, malformed images are likely to just result in a straight-up 500 error.

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.
